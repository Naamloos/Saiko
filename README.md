## Hosting your own instance
To host your own instance, clone or download this repo and build the project. After starting the program, you will get a message telling you your configuration file has been created. Go to your build folder to edit SaikoConfig.json. More info about the configuration file can be found at the wiki. After this has been done, restart the program. It will automatically detect what environment you are running it on and select the best websocket provider for your environment (mono, win7/older or win8/newer)
